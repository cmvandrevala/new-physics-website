title: The Dot Product Between the Sum and Difference of Two Vectors
---

Suppose we have two vectors - $\vec{A}$ and $\vec{B}$. We know that the dot product between them is given by $\vec{A} \cdot \vec{B}$. However, what if we want to calculate the dot product of their sum and difference?

$$
(\vec{A} + \vec{B}) \cdot (\vec{A} - \vec{B}) = \: ?
$$

The dot product is distributive over vector addition. Thus, we can use the FOIL method to expand the expression:

$$
(\vec{A} + \vec{B}) \cdot (\vec{A} - \vec{B}) = \vec{A} \cdot \vec{A} - \vec{A} \cdot \vec{B} + \vec{B} \cdot \vec{A} - \vec{B} \cdot \vec{B}
$$

Recall that the dot product is commutative, meaning that $\vec{A} \cdot \vec{B} = \vec{B} \cdot \vec{A}$. We can cancel out two terms in the expression above to simplify it further:

$$
(\vec{A} + \vec{B}) \cdot (\vec{A} - \vec{B}) = \vec{A} \cdot \vec{A} - \vec{B} \cdot \vec{B}
$$

The dot product of a vector with itself is the magnitude of the vector squared. Thus, we can simplify this expression once again:

$$
(\vec{A} + \vec{B}) \cdot (\vec{A} - \vec{B}) = ||\vec{A}||^2 - ||\vec{B}||^2
$$

And there we have it! We got a nice, simplified expression involving the magnitudes of the two vectors. Pretty neat!
